# Mentor: A developer protégé guidebook

## Intro

This is a guidebook for those looking to become a developer protégé. It contains the skeleton of a self paced curriculum and guidelines for an ideal mentor/protégé relationship.

## Format

I believe the best relationships are two-way, and mentoring is no exception. Therefore, in order to get the most out of a mentorship, you (the protégé) must have a [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) goal for what you wish to accomplish. Your goal could be to develop a new API, get a job in a particular field, etc.

In exchange for helping you reach your goal, I ask for your assistance by contributing to one of my [pinned open source repos](https://github.com/reubano).

## Office Hours

Once a month, I'll allocate 2 hours for a communal live-video session (skype/google hangeouts) to review code, answer questions, discuss goals, etc.

## Stages

### Self study

- [ ] pick your primary SMART goal and create an [issue](https://github.com/reubano/mentor/issues/new) 
- [ ] read/view the [linked resources](#resources) and submit any questions as [issues](https://github.com/reubano/mentor/issues/new)
- [ ] select a [pinned repo](https://github.com/reubano) to contribute to, then create an [issue](https://github.com/reubano/mentor/issues/new) indicating your selection
- [ ] read your selected repo's README and take note of any confusing wording or code examples 
- [ ] use your selected repo in a project
- [ ] submit a PR to your selected repo

### Live sessions

- [ ] review your goal(s)
- [ ] review your current progress
- [ ] answer questions about the [linked resources](#resources) 
- [ ] answer questions about your selected repo
