# What does it take to become a data scientist?

Generally a data scientist is a good in several areas: web development, data analysis and visualization, basic stats, and scripting. So the key is beefing up on your weak area(s). Language wise you should be proficient in Python, JS/Node, BASH, and optionally R, Julia, or Clojure/Scala. Technology wise you should know the ins and outs of RDBMS and be familiar with a few NOSQL DBs like MongoDB, Redis, CouchDB... Then there is the whole "big data" movement around Storm/Spark, Cassandra, Hadoop.... I personally haven't gone down that road yet, but it could be helpful to know your way around it. Also, read up on "functional programming". It's really changed how I think about and write code.

It's not really necessary that you have a background in CS either. I studied chemical engineering and am mostly a self taught programmer.

Overall, I think data rules the world, and its spoils will go to those that understand how to harness its power. To that end, mastering APIs, data analysis, and data visualization will open up more doors than you can imagine.
